# Email Spam Detection using Python

**A robust Python-based email spam detection model leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.**

This project aims to develop a highly accurate spam email detection system using Python. By training a machine learning model on a large dataset of labeled emails, we can effectively classify incoming emails as spam or ham (non-spam).

# Key Features:

**Data Preprocessing:**
Text cleaning and normalization
Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words

**Model Training:**
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest)
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Model Evaluation:**
Rigorous evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
A simple and intuitive interface to input emails for classification
